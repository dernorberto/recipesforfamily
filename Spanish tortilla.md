## details

* source: https://www.kidspot.com.au/kitchen/recipes/simple-spanish-omelette-1019
* opinion: family loves it, do mention to your kids that it has chippies (fries) in it
* it's better to cook two batches in a smaller frying pan (26cm) than a single thick one - with the time it takes to cook the eggs, the tortilla will be very dry
* you can do tortillas with anything, chorizo, ham, olives
* it is a very simple recipe, even if the instructions look long

## ingredients

* 300g waxy potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
* 5 eggs
* half a medium onion, finely sliced
* 1 cup peas, frozen or fresh
* half a red pepper, diced
* 1 tomato, diced
* 3 tbsp olive oil
* Salt and pepper

## preparation

* Lightly salt the potatoes slices.
* Place a large frying pan on high heat and add 2 tbs olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the potato slices
* Turn and separate them over the heat for 5 minutes – try to keep them moving enough that they don’t turn brown.
* Lower the heat and add the onion to the frying pan and place a lid on the pan to cover.
* Move the potato and onion slices around the pan every couple of minutes until both are just cooked through.
* In a mixing bowl, add the eggs and lightly whisk until the whites and yolk are just combined. Add salt and pepper.
* When the potatoes and onions are cooked, add them to the whisked eggs. Add the rest of the vegetables (peas and tomato)
Heat the remaining 1 tbsp of olive oil in the frying pan and allow to come back to a high heat.
* Pour the egg and vegetable mixture into the pan and immediately turn the heat down to low.
* Cook for 15 mins or until there is no liquid egg on the top of the omelette.
* Turn the omelette by flipping onto a dinner plate and then sliding the it back into the pan - I find this one very tricky
* Cook for another 5 mins. Serve in slices.
